      "517How do I get the current time in Python?ThetimemoduleThetimemodule provides functions that tell us the time in \"seconds since the epoch\" as well as other utilities.import timeUnix Epoch TimeThis is the format you should get timestamps in for saving in databases. It is a simple floating-point number that can be converted to an integer. It is also good for arithmetic in seconds, as it represents the number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970, 00:00:00, and it is memory light relative to the other representations of time we'll be looking at next:>>> time.time()\n",
      "1424233311.771502This timestamp does not account for leap-seconds, so it's not linear - leap seconds are ignored. So while it is not equivalent to the international UTC standard, it is close, and therefore quite good for most cases of record-keeping.This is not ideal for human scheduling, however. If you have a future event you wish to take place at a certain point in time, you'll want to store that time with a string that can be parsed into adatetimeobject or a serializeddatetimeobject (these will be described later).time.ctimeYou can also represent the current time in the way preferred by your operating system (which means it can change when you change your system preferences, so don't rely on this to be standard across all systems, as I've seen others expect). This is typically user friendly, but doesn't typically result in strings one can sort chronologically:>>> time.ctime()\n",
      "'Tue Feb 17 23:21:56 2015'You can hydrate timestamps into human readable form withctimeas well:>>> time.ctime(1424233311.771502)\n",
      "'Tue Feb 17 23:21:51 2015'This conversion is also not good for record-keeping (except in text that will only be parsed by humans - and with improved Optical Character Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, I think the number of these cases will diminish).datetimemoduleThedatetimemodule is also quite useful here:>>> import datetimedatetime.datetime.nowThedatetime.nowis a class method that returns the current time. It uses thetime.localtimewithout the timezone info (if not given, otherwise see timezone aware below). It has a representation (which would allow you to recreate an equivalent object) echoed on the shell, but when printed (or coerced to astr), it is in human readable (and nearly ISO) format, and the lexicographic sort is equivalent to the chronological sort:>>> datetime.datetime.now()\n",

You want there to be no confusion as to which timezone a string or serialized datetime object was intended for.If you're displaying the time with Python for the user,ctimeworks nicely, not in a table (it doesn't typically sort well), but perhaps in a clock.
